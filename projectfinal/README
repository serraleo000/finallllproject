hello mr trib, as you can see i researched flask and got good at it, however this means there is special instructions to run my code.
copy the files onto your laptop
open your terminal
open the project file in your terminal
run these 3 codes
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run

then click the https link it gives you.


this all requires you to install flask first which is
pip install flask

in your terminal
